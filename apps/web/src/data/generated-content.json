Personally, I am a relentless **tinkerer**, serial **hobbyist** and obsessive **optimizer**.\n\nRight now I'm heavy on tennis and 3D printing, though lately I've been trying to make more space for art and mindfulness—hoping to share more of that soon.\n\nThis site is a glimpse into that mess. Check out my **[Projects](#folder/projects)** or read through some **[Thoughts](#folder/thoughts)**. Just know that everything here is in varying degrees of \"finished,\" so be gracious as you explore and don't hesitate to reach out!\n\n---\n\n## Contact\n\n- **Email:** [evancmullins@gmail.com](mailto:evancmullins@gmail.com)\n- **GitHub:** [@ecmulli](https://github.com/ecmulli)"

      "content": "# Why this site looks like this\n\nIt took me way too long to put together a personal site.\n\nThe main blocker? I couldn't figure out how to express myself in a standard format. Most websites and social profiles feel too narrow—they only capture a thin slice of who we are as complex people.\n\n## The Authenticity Problem\n\nI have a problem with inauthenticity: I can't *not* be myself. I couldn't bring myself to build a \"standard\" site that only showcased a polished professional portfolio. I needed a container that could hold all of me.\n\n## The Solution: evanmOS\n\nI needed something multidimensional. Something that could hold finished, polished projects right alongside half-baked thoughts and messy experiments.\n\nWhat handles that better than an Operating System? We use them every day. We organize our lives in them. If you're like me, you might even \"think\" in file structures.\n\n---\n\nSo, welcome to **evanmOS**. Look around, open some folders, and see what you find."
