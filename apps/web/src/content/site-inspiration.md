# Site Inspiration

## Why this site looks like this

It took me way too long to put together a personal site.

The main blocker? I couldn't figure out how to express myself in a standard format. Most websites and social profiles feel too narrow—they only capture a thin slice of who we are as complex people.

## The Authenticity Problem

I have a problem with inauthenticity: I can't _not_ be myself. I couldn't bring myself to build a "standard" site that only showcased a polished professional portfolio. I needed a container that could hold all of me.

## The Solution: evanmOS

I needed something multidimensional. Something that could hold finished, polished projects right alongside half-baked thoughts and messy experiments.

What handles that better than an Operating System? We use them every day. We organize our lives in them. If you're like me, you might even "think" in file structures.

So, welcome to **evanmOS**. Look around, open some folders, and see what you find.
