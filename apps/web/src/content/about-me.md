# Hey, I'm Evan.

Professionally, I'm a **Data Scientist** and **Analytics Engineer**. Personally, I have a habit of collecting way too many hobbies.

Right now I'm heavy on tennis and 3D printing, though lately I've been trying to make more space for art and mindfulness—hoping to share more of that soon.

This site is a glimpse into that mess. Check out my **Projects** or read through some **Thoughts**. Just know that everything here is in varying degrees of "finished," so be gracious as you explore and don't hesitate to reach out!
