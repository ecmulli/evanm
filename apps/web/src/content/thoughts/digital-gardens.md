Digital Gardens
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Date: January 10, 2026

I've been thinking about websites as gardens.

Not the manicured, corporate kind - but the
wild, personal kind. The kind that grows
organically over time.

A digital garden is:
• Always a work in progress
• Personal and imperfect
• A place for ideas to grow
• Connected through winding paths

This desktop is my garden. Each file is a
seed. Some might grow into something bigger.
Others might just stay as little notes.

And that's okay.
