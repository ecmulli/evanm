On Simplicity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

There's something beautiful about constraints.

When you have limited resources, limited pixels,
limited colors - you're forced to be intentional
about every decision you make.

Modern software often suffers from feature bloat.
We add more because we can, not because we should.

The old Mac interfaces understood this. Every
element had a purpose. Every interaction was
considered.

Maybe that's why they still feel so satisfying
to use, even decades later.

Sometimes less really is more.
