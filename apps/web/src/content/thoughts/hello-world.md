Hello, World!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Date: January 1, 2026

The classic first program. The tradition that
spans decades and countless programming languages.

    10 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
    20 END

Why do we start here?

Maybe because it's a greeting. A first word.
A declaration that we exist in this digital
space and we have something to say.

Hello, World. Nice to meet you.
